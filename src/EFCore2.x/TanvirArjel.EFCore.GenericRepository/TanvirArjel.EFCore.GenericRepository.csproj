    <Description>This library is an almost perfect Generic Repository implementation for EF Core ORM which will remove developers pain to write repository layer for each .NET Core and .NET project.

This library includes following notable features:

1. This library can be run on any .NET Core or .NET application which has .NET Standard 2.0 support.

2. It’s providing the Generic Repository through Unit of Work pattern.

3. It has all the required methods to query your data in whatever way you want without getting IQueryable&lt;T&gt; from the repository.

4. It also has Specification&lt;T&gt; pattern support so that you can build your query dynamically i.e. differed query building.

5. It has also database level projection support for your query.

6. It also has support to run raw SQL command against your relational database.

7. It also has support to choose whether you would like to track your query entity/entities or not.

8. It has also support to reset your EF Core DbContext state whenever you really needed.

9.  Most importantly, it has full Unit Testing support.</Description>
