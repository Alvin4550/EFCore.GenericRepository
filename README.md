# EF Core Generic Repository

This library is an almost perfect Generic Repository implementation for EF Core ORM which will remove developers' pain to write repository layer for each .NET Core and .NET project.

## This library includes following notable features:

1. This library can be run on any .NET Core or .NET application which has .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.1 support.

2. Itâ€™s providing the Generic Repository through Unit of Work pattern.

3. It has all the required methods to query your data in whatever way you want without getting IQueryable<T> from the repository.

4. It also has **`Specification<T>`** pattern support so that you can build your query dynamically i.e. differed query building.

5. It has also database level projection support for your query.

6. It also has support to run raw SQL command against your relational database.

7. It also has support to choose whether you would like to track your query entity/entities or not.

8. It has also support to reset your EF Core DbContext state whenever you really needed.

9.  Most importantly, it has full Unit Testing support.

## Giving a star*

**If you find this library useful, please don't forget to encouraging me to do such more stuffs by giving a star to this repository. Thank you.**

## How do I get started?

First install the appropriate version of `TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository` [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository) package into your project as follows:

**For EF Core 2.x :**

    Install-Package TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository -Version 2.0.0
    
**For EF Core 3.0 :**

    Install-Package TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository -Version 3.0.0
    
**For EF Core >= 3.1 :**

    Install-Package TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository -Version 3.1.0
    
Then in the `ConfirugeServices` method of the `Startup` class:

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        string connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("RepositoryDbConnection");
        services.AddDbContext<DemoDbContext>(option => option.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
        
        services.AddGenericRepository<DemoDbContext>(); // Call it just after registering your DbConext.
    }
    
## Usage:

Now inject `IUnitOfWork` interface in your relevant class constructor and use as follows:

    public class EmployeeService
    {
         private readonly IUnitOfWork _unitOfWork;
         public EmployeeService(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork)
         {
             _unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
         }
         
         public async Task<Employee> GetEmployeeAsync(int employeeId)
         {
             Employee employee = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>().GetEntityByIdAsync(1);
             return employee;
         }
    }
    
## More Details:

#### 1. To get all the data:

    var employeeList =  await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>().GetEntityListAsync();
    
    var noTrackedEmployeeList = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>().GetEntityListAsync(asNoTracking: true);
    
#### 2. To get filtered list of data:

    var employeeList =  await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>()
                        .GetEntityListAsync(e => e.EmployeeName.Contains("Tanvir") && e.DepartmentName == "Software");
                        
    var noTrackedEmployeeList = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>()
                                .GetEntityListAsync(e => e.EmployeeName.Contains("Tanvir") && e.DepartmentName == "Software", asNoTracking: true);

#### 3. To get list of data by Specification<T>:
    
    Specification<Employee> specification = new Specification<Employee>();
    specification.Conditions.Add(e => e.EmployeeName.Contains("Tanvir"));
    specification.Includes = ep => ep.Include(e => e.Department);
    specification.OrderBy = sp => sp.OrderBy(e => e.EmployeeName).ThenBy(e => e.DepartmentName);
    specification.Skip = 0;
    specification.Take = 10;

    List<Employee> employeeList = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>()
                                  .GetEntityListAsync(specification);
                                  
    List<Employee> noTrackedEmployeeList = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>()
                                           .GetEntityListAsync(specification, true);
                                  
 #### 4. To get projected entity list:
    
    Expression<Func<Employee, object>> selectExpression = e => new { e.EmployeeId, e.EmployeeName };
    var projectedList = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>().GetProjectedEntityListAsync(selectExpression);
                      
 #### 5. To get filtered projected entity list:
 
    Expression<Func<Employee, object>> selectExpression = e => new { e.EmployeeId, e.EmployeeName };
    var filteredProjectedList = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>()
                      .GetProjectedEntityListAsync(e => e.IsActive, selectExpression);
                                            
 #### 6. To get projected entity list by `Specification<T>`:
 
    Specification<Employee> specification = new Specification<Employee>();
    specification.Conditions.Add(e => e.EmployeeName.Contains("Tanvir"));
    specification.Includes = ep => ep.Include(e => e.Department);
    specification.OrderBy = sp => sp.OrderBy(e => e.EmployeeName).ThenBy(e => e.DepartmentName);
    specification.Skip = 0;
    specification.Take = 10;
    
    Expression<Func<Employee, object>> selectExpression = e => new { e.EmployeeId, e.EmployeeName };
    var projectedList = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>()
                      .GetProjectedEntityListAsync(specification, selectExpression);
                      
#### 7. To get an entity by Id (primary key):

    Employee employee = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>().GetEntityByIdAsync(1);
    
    Employee noTrackedEmployee = await _unitOfWork.Repository<Employee>().GetEntityByIdAsync(1, true);
    
#### 8. To get a projected entity by Id (primary key):
    
    Expression<Func<Employee, object>> selectExpression = e => new { e.EmployeeId, e.EmployeeName };

#### 14. To create or insert a new entity:

    Employee employeeToBeCreated = new Employee()
    {
