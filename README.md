# EF Core Generic Repository

This library is Generic Repository implementation for EF Core ORM which will remove developers' pain to write repository layer for each .NET Core and .NET project.

## This library includes following notable features:

1. This library can be run on any .NET Core or .NET application which has .NET Core 3.1, .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET 5.0 support.

2. It’s providing the Generic Repository with database transaction support.

3. It has all the required methods to query your data in whatever way you want without getting IQueryable<T> from the repository.

4. It also has **`Specification<T>`** pattern support so that you can build your query dynamically i.e. differed query building.

5. It also has database level projection support for your query.

6. It also has support to run raw SQL command against your relational database.

7. It also has support to choose whether you would like to track your query entity/entities or not.

8. It also has support to reset your EF Core DbContext state whenever you really needed.

9. Most importantly, it has full Unit Testing support.

## Giving a star (⭐)

**If you find this library useful, please don't forget to encouraging me to do such more stuffs by giving a star to this repository. Thank you.**

## How do I get started?

First install the latest version of `TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository` [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository) package into your project as follows:

**Package Manager Console:**

    Install-Package TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository
    
**.NET CLI:**

    dotnet add package TanvirArjel.EFCore.GenericRepository
    
Then in the `ConfirugeServices` method of the `Startup` class:

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        string connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("RepositoryDbConnection");
        services.AddDbContext<DemoDbContext>(option => option.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
        
        services.AddGenericRepository<DemoDbContext>(); // Call it just after registering your DbConext.
    }
    
## Usage: Query

    public class EmployeeService
    {
         private readonly IRepository _repository;
         
         public EmployeeService(IRepository repository)
         {
             _repository = repository;
         }
         
         public async Task<Employee> GetEmployeeAsync(int employeeId)
         {
             Employee employee = await _repository.GetByIdAsync<Employee>(1);
             return employee;
         }
    }
    
## Usage: Command

    public class EmployeeService
    {
         private readonly IRepository _repository;
         
         public EmployeeService(IRepository repository)
         {
             _repository = repository;
         }
         
         // Single database operation.
         public async Task<int> CreateAsync(Employee employee)
         {
             object[] primaryKeys = await _repository.InsertAsync(employee);
             return (int)primaryKeys[0];
         }
         
         // Multiple database operation.
         public async Task<int>> CreateAsync(Employee employee)
         {
                IDbContextTransaction transaction = await _repository.BeginTransactionAsync(IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted);
                try
                {
                    object[] primaryKeys = await _repository.InsertAsync(employee);
                    
                    long employeeId = (long)primaryKeys[0];
                    EmployeeHistory employeeHistory = new EmployeeHistory()
                    {
                        EmployeeId = employeeId,
                        DepartmentId = employee.DepartmentId,
                        EmployeeName = employee.EmployeeName
                    };

                    await _repository.InsertAsync(employeeHistory);

                    await transaction.CommitAsync();
                    
                    return employeeId;
                }
                catch (Exception)
                {
                    await transaction.RollbackAsync();
                    throw;
                }
        }
    
## More Details:

#### 1. To get all the data:

    var noTrackedEmployeeList = await _repository
                                .GetListAsync<Employee>(e => e.EmployeeName.Contains("Tanvir") && e.DepartmentName == "Software", asNoTracking: true);

#### 3. To get a list of data by Specification<T>:
    
    Specification<Employee> specification = new Specification<Employee>();
    specification.Conditions.Add(e => e.EmployeeName.Contains("Tanvir"));
    specification.Includes = ep => ep.Include(e => e.Department);
    specification.OrderBy = sp => sp.OrderBy(e => e.EmployeeName).ThenBy(e => e.DepartmentName);
    specification.Skip = 0;
    specification.Take = 10;

    List<Employee> employeeList = await _repository.GetListAsync<Employee>(specification);

#### 20. To get the count of entities with or without condition:

    int count =   await _repository.GetCountAsync<Employee>(); // Count of all
    int count =   await _repository.GetCountAsync<Employee>(e => e.EmployeeName = "Tanvir"); // Count with specified condtion
    
    long longCount =   await _repository.GetLongCountAsync<Employee>(); // Long count of all
    long longCount =   await _repository.GetLongCountAsync<Employee>(e => e.EmployeeName = "Tanvir"); // Long count with specified condtion
